Some function for Fuzzy logic implementation 

- This library was coded to fully commit a fuzzy logic process including: Fuzzyfication, Rule implementation and Defuzzyfication. 
- However, this library may not support all the techniques that belong to each of the mentioned process. The library only designed and coded to support author's graduation thesis
- This was coded in 2018 and uploaded to Github 2022, author has no longer work in embedded field or signal and system project. Thus, he cannot fully explain for what he has coded years ago
- His interest for embedded field and "signal and system" still there though, if reader has any question or topic to discuss, the author will still love to discuss it with you
